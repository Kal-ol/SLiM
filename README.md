Base Model (Model 0)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Annual life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are sexual and there is backcrossing.
- any mating between hybrid and parents will produce more hybrids


Base+Perennial (Model 1)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Perennial life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are sexual and there is backcrossing.
- any mating between hybrid and parents will produce more hybrids

RI hybrid (Model 2)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Annual life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are sexual but no backcrossing

RI+perennial hybrid (Model 3)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Perennial life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are sexual but no backcrossing

Asexual hybrid (Model 4)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Annual life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are asexual

Asexual+perennial hybrid (Model 5)
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Perennial life history
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are asexual
