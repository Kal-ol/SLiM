Base Model 
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model with:
- 2-locus BDMI haplotype fitness table (via hapIndex())
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- p3 are sexual and there is backcrossing.
- any mating between hybrid and parents will produce more hybrids
