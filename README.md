Annual
- non overlapping generations
- 3-pop nonWF hybrid model
- multi-locus BDMI 
- Ancestry markers - lineage specific fixed neutral alleles
- Multiplicative overall fitness: w_total = w_comp * w_bdmi
- Hybrid offspring flagged in p1/p2 and migrated to p3
- Admixture index is measured based on distribution of ancestral markers
- p3 are sexual and there is backcrossing.
- any mating between hybrid and parents will produce more hybrids
